        <p>Skillet is an <span>American Christian</span>rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1996. The band
            currently
            consists of husband John Cooper (lead vocals, bass) and wife Korey Cooper (rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing
            vocals) along with Jen Ledger (drums, vocals) and Seth Morrison (lead guitar). The band has released eleven
            albums, two of which, Collide and Comatose, received Grammy nominations.[1] Two of their albums, Comatose
            and
            Awake, are certified Platinum and Double Platinum respectively by the RIAA, while Rise and Unleashed are
            certified Gold as of June 29, 2020.[2] Four of their songs, "Monster", "Hero", "Awake and Alive", and "Feel
            Invincible", are certified Multi-Platinum (5× Platinum, 3× Platinum, and 2× Platinum respectively), while
            another two, "Whispers in the Dark" and "Comatose", are certified Platinum, and another four, "Rebirthing",
            "Not
            Gonna Die", "The Last Night", and "The Resistance" are certified Gold.[3]

            Skillet went through several line-up changes early in their career, leaving founder John Cooper as the only
            original member remaining in the band. They are known for a relentless touring schedule, which garnered
            them.
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>Early years (1996–2002)
            Skillet formed in 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band
            Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but
            they
            disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project.[5]
            They
            decided to name the experiment "Skillet". After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer.
            Skillet
            was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront
            Records.
            In 1996, they released their demo album Right Upside Your Head. On October 29 of the same year, they
            released a
            self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured
            the
            United States.

            Cooper has said the band's name was meant to be humorous, as the other founding members had already been in
            other bands, each with a different sound and style. The pastor of Covenant Community Church in Memphis—where
            the
            band was formed as a worship band side project—gave them their name as he felt they were like "southern
            cooking,
            where you just toss a bunch of different things into a big ol' skillet and see what it turns out
            like."[6][7]

            Skillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled Hey You, I Love Your Soul, which was released
            in
            April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release,
            Skillet
            abandoned their grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock and style. Cooper's wife Korey was enlisted
            soon
            after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate his performance duties.[citation needed]

            Shortly before the band began recording for their third album, Invincible, Steorts left to be with his
            family
            and launch Visible Music College, and Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist. Korey Cooper
            joined
            the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of Invincible. Because of this change, the
            musical
            style on Invincible changed to a more electronic sound.[8] Soon after the release of Invincible in early
            2000,
            Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer's position.

            The band released their first worship album and fourth album overall, Ardent Worship, in late 2000. The band
            kept much of their sound from Invincible on their next album Alien Youth.[8] With little time between
            touring
            and recording, Skillet released Alien Youth on August 28, 2001, which was the first album that John Cooper
            took
            on production duties. Before the release of Alien Youth, Haaland left the band, and Ben Kasica took over on
            guitar.[citation needed]<a href="https://google.com">1</a></p>
